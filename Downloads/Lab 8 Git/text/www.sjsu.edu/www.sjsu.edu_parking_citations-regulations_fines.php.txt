Citation Fines and Descriptions
Responsibility for establishing rules and regulations regarding the operation and
                  parking of vehicles on university property is given to the University President pursuant
                  to Section 21113 (a) of the California Vehicle Code (CVC). 
A portion of the fines collected for parking violations are forwarded to the State
                  of California to fund the construction, renovation and lease of State Court and detention
                  facilities. The balance is used to fund alternative transportation programs at SJSU.
If you received a parking citation, you must respond by either paying the amount due
                  or appealing the parking citation(s) within 21 days. Failure to respond will result
                  in the forfeiture of the right to an appeal, assessment of late penalties, DMV vehicle
                  registration hold(s), and/or other authorized Collection methods.
