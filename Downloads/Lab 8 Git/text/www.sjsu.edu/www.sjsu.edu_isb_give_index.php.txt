The Future of SJSU Science
SJSU's Science Park will be the focal point for collaboration on campus. Our partners
                                    in this endeavor are an important part of that collaboration, ensuring funding for
                                    this ambitious new vision for science and innovation. As SJSU adapts to meet the needs
                                    of an increasingly science and technology intensive labor market, our future will
                                    depend on innovative partnerships to prepare students for careers that demand a strong
                                    foundation in the sciences.
