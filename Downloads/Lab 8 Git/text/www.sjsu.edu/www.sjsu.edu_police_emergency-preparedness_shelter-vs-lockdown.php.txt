Lock Down vs. Shelter in Place
Lock Down
Situations where there is immediate threat to your location such as:
               

Dangerous incident in the immediate neighborhood
Dangerous incident close to your location
Any situation where you feel lock, barricade, and hide is the safest alternative

HIDE = Lock Down

If escape is not feasible; hide and create a stronghold
Lock the door, turn off the lights and close the blinds
Take cover behind large items
Silence your cell phones and turn off vibrate mode
Remain quiet
Move away from doors and windows

Shelter in Place
Situations where there is no immediate threat to your location such as:
               

Dangerous incident in the surrounding neighborhood
Dangerous incident at a nearby school
Any situation where you feel keeping your staff inside is the safest alternative

Shelter in Place Considerations

Close all doors and windows (no barricades)
Remain inside; engage in normal indoor activities
Keep movement outdoors to a minimum
Use buddy system when leaving your location
Communicate with your co-workers if you plan to leave
