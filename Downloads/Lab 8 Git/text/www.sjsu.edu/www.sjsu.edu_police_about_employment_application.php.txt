Employment Application Process
Application
If you would like to join our team, you can search for job openings and submit your
                  application at Job Applicants.
Physical Abilities and Written Exam
Entry-level applicants are required to take the POST Physical Abilities test and written
                  Entry-level Law Enforcement Test Battery.  Academy graduates (within three years)
                  and lateral applicants are not required.  
Panel Interview and Chief's Interview
For those applicants who successfully pass both the physical abilities test and written
                  examination, the next step in the application process is an interview with a diverse
                  panel comprised of UPD staff and staff/faculty members associated with SJSU who will
                  assess the oral communication skills and other factors of the candidate. The oral
                  board panel will make recommendations to the Chief of Police regarding who should
                  move forward to the Chief's interview. The Chief of Police will determine which candidate(s)
                  will undergo the background investigation.
Background Investigation
A thorough background investigation, including a criminal history check, will be conducted
                  in order determine the candidate's suitability for the position of Police Officer.
Medical and Psychological Evaluation
Medical and psychological evaluations are conducted to ensure applicants are free
                  from any physical, emotional or mental condition that might adversely affect the exercise
                  of the powers of a peace officer. Medical evaluation includes drug screening.
Final Review and Appointment
When the background investigation is completed, a final report is submitted to the
                  Chief of Police for final review. It is the decision of the Chief of Police to determine
                  suitability for employment. A completed background investigation does not guarantee
                  employment; it is simply a review and evaluation of information with the discretion
                  to hire solely up to the Chief of Police.
