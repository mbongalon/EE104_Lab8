About Us

SJSU is an urban campus located on 154 acres in the heart of California's third largest
                  city. From its beginning in 1857 as a teacher's college, SJSU has grown into a thriving
                  community of more than 33,000 faculty, students and staff.
As SJSU grew, so did the City of San José.  Once an agricultural community of a few thousand homes, San José is now the third
                  largest city in California with a population of more than 925,000 people.
The University Police Department (UPD) is responsible for ensuring campus safety for
                  all staff and students. UPD consists of a diverse team of twenty four sworn peace
                  officers and over fifty civilian personnel, including Parking Services, Library Security,
                  Housing Security, Police Cadets and admin staff.  
UPD is comprised of the Chief's office and two bureaus:

Administration Bureau
Operations Bureau

UPD annually documents about 60,000 incidents, arrests between 800 and 900 suspects
                  and writes about 2,500 reports. The Police Communications Center dispatches UPD personnel
                  to more than 50,000 calls for service each year. UPD and Parking Services personnel annually work more than 200 special events attended by over 500,000 people.
