Emergency Response and Preparedness
The Emergency Preparedness Unit supports the SJSU campus community by implementing
                  programs and projects in emergency planning, training, response, mitigation and recovery.
Our mission is to prepare the campus to manage and recover from any type of emergency
                  or disaster.  The Emergency Operations Plan [pdf] is maintained and tested to ensure competency and readiness amongst campus staff.
