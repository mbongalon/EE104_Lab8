University Learning Goals







History










The SJSU Story Begins with People
Founded in 1857, San José State's history began before the Civil War, as the first
                                    State Normal School, which trained teachers who educated the people of a young California. Now,
                                    SJSU is a dynamic comprehensive university that anchors the 10th largest city in the
                                    United States, and Spartans are found around the globe. 







Our People










Students
Students discover what inspires them through a breadth of majors, unique programs
                                    and opportunities for research—as well as more than 450 student organizations and
                                    Division I athletics. 











Faculty
Faculty members combine research, scholarship and creative activity with industry
                                    or practical experience—incubating a problem-solving and entrepreneurial mindset. 











Alumni
Through our dynamic campus community and international network of more than 270,000
                                    alumni, opportunities abound for sharing a broad range of perspectives.







Inclusive, Healthy Culture










Diversity
SJSU has a long history of student civil rights activism, service to first-generation
                                    students, and racial and ethnic diversity, all within the vibrant cultural communities
                                    of Silicon Valley.











Sustainability
Ongoing campus-wide efforts minimize SJSU’s "ecological footprint" by reducing campus
                                    energy consumption, water use and waste. SJSU offers a wide range of academic courses
                                    and programs related to sustainability.











Health and Wellness
Health and wellness are critical to student academic success. At SJSU, students can
                                    take care of all dimensions of wellness: physical, social, emotional, occupational,
                                    multicultural, environmental, spiritual and intellectual.
