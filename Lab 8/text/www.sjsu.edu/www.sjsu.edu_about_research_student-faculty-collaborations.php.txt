Student-Faculty Collaborations







Teaching Through Research
San Jose State's research endeavors play a critical role in preparing graduate and
                                 undergraduate students, who work side by side with faculty mentors. With $60 million
                                 in annual research, SJSU is a top-200 school nationally in terms of research spending.
                                 The university's students and faculty members apply their inherent creativity and
                                 diversity of thought and experience to research aimed at solving the most pressing
                                 problems facing society—both locally and globally.
                              






Unique Learning Environments










Fire Weather Research Lab
The only team of its kind in the United States, Craig Clements’ Fire Weather Research
                                    Laboratory studies and decodes wildfire behavior to improve fire management and prevention.
                                 











"Super" Research with Machines
Ehsan Khatami’s research aims to help scientists understand how superconductivity
                                    works—a finding that could potentially pave the way for a room-temperature superconductor,
                                    which would improve transportation and data storage, and make homes more energy efficient
                                    by creating materials that allow better use of electricity.
                                 











Solving DNA Puzzles, One Worm at a Time
Inside Miri VanHoven's neurogenetics lab, she and her students explore how the nervous
                                    system is formed and how potential genetic misfires may cause diseases such as autism
                                    and schizophrenia.
                                 















Tools for Student and Faculty Researchers
San Jose State provides the tools researchers need to thrive. From identifying funding
                                    and proposal writing to managing an award, SJSU's Research Foundation, Office of Research,
                                    Center for Faculty Development and King Library support student and faculty researchers contributing
                                    to a range of fields.
