President's Statement
San José State University on Equal Opportunity, Affirmative Action and Non-Discrimination
San José State University plays a vital role in the dynamic and multicultural Silicon
                  Valley in developing future leaders and in preparing our graduates to succeed in an
                  increasingly global marketplace. The University is dedicated to the principles of
                  equal opportunity and non-discrimination. These principles permeate all facets of
                  University life: in the admission, housing and education of  students; in policies
                  and practices governing programs of extracurricular life and activities; and in the
                  employment of faculty, staff, and students. Discrimination of any kind, including,
                  but not limited to age, ancestry, color, creed, disability, marital status, medical
                  condition, national origin, pregnancy, race, religion, sex, or sexual orientation,
                  is an affront to the entire University community and is strictly prohibited.
               
San José State University works vigorously to achieve an atmosphere free of discrimination
                  and harassment - one that is reflective of our richly multicultural society. By doing
                  so, we ensure the interchange of diverse views and growth of mutual respect. The University
                  is proud of its record and recognizes the immeasurable contributions this work has
                  had in making it a distinguished institution of higher learning and an employer of
                  choice in Silicon Valley.
               
If you have any questions regarding our University's equal employment opportunity
                  policies or the complaint procedure, you may contact the Office for Equal Opportunity
                  Office at (408) 924-2450.
