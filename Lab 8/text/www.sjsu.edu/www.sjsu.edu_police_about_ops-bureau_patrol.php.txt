Police Patrol
We patrol the SJSU campus and the surrounding area 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
                  We patrol the campus on foot, on bicycle and by vehicle in an effort to deter crime
                  and to be readily available to the campus community.
During special events on campus, additional police officers will be on duty, augmented
                  by officers from other university police departments and surrounding law enforcement
                  agencies.
For additional information, see Jurisdiction and Enforcement Authority.
