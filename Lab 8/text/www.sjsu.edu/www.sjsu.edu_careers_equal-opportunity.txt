Equal Opportunity

San José State University (SJSU) is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action employer
                  committed to nondiscrimination on the basis of age, ancestry, citizenship status,
                  color, creed, disability, ethnicity, gender, genetic information, marital status,
                  medical condition, national origin, race, religion or lack thereof, sex, sexual orientation,
                  transgender, or protected veteran status consistent with applicable federal and state
                  laws. This policy applies to all SJSU students, faculty and staff programs and activities.
                  Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, and certain other federal and state
                  laws, prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex in all education programs and activities
                  operated by the university (both on and off campus).Reasonable accommodations will be provided for applicants with disabilities who self-disclose.
